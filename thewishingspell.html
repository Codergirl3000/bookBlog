            <p>
                <br><br> For this article, I chose to take a trip down memory lane and review one of my old favorite
                books. This book (and series as a whole) definitely still holds up now as much as it did for my fourth
                grade self. As an acclaimed Disney nerd, I loved all things fairy tale and fantasy, so when I first
                encountered this series, it was the perfect read for me. Soon enough, I got hooked. This series carries
                the fondest memories and makes me so nostalgic of the first time I really got into reading, a hobby I
                still continue to love. The plot is entertaining to follow in itself, but the lore throughout the series
                makes this book so phenomenal, and it makes you feel like you are inside the story. The book moves
                rather fast paced, so as a quick reader, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time while reading.
                <br><br> The Wishing Spell recounts the adventure of twins Alex and Conor, who live a seemingly normal
                life until they are given a treasured fairy tale book from their mysterious grandmother. One day, their
                world turns upside down as they are swept into the realm of fairy tales and magic that they had only
                read about. As they explore foreign territories and meet allies along the way, they also face magical
                oppositions and villains that could create an unexpected journey home.
                <br><br> One thing I loved about this book is how much effort is put into the lore of the Fairytale
                World. The author, Chris Colfer, creates such relatable and loveable characters, that you can't help but
                root for in their epic story. Additionally, the villain, the Evil Queen, has such a good backstory and
                well written character arc that you almost feel sympathy for her, which is in my opinion, what crafts a
                quality villain. In terms of its scenery, this book contains such great descriptions of the land that
                you feel like you are fully immersed in the story and you are right there with the characters. Something
                to note that might be less enjoyable to some readers is the fact that this book was written with a
                younger audience in mind. For instance, I read this book and series when I was in the fourth grade. The
                content and pace might be a little too easy for readers over 12.
                <br><br> Overall, The Wishing Spell is just a fun read if you're looking for something light hearted and
                a read that will take you back to your childhood. It was nominated for the best Middle Grade and
                Children’s read so I would recommend this book to 8+ year olds because that was around the age I first
                read it and the content itself is pretty lighthearted besides for some battle scenes. I would recommend
                this to anyone in around middle school who is looking for a fantasy series that they can easily fall in
                love with. This book was intended for a younger audience so keep that in mind, but I believe anyone can
                still enjoy this super entertaining and magical read. Based on nostalgia and how I fell so deeply in
                love with this book during my childhood, I would rate it an 8/10. I’ve grown fonder and fonder of this
                series as I look back on it, as it was such a pinnacle point in my childhood. I can strongly say that
                this series was one that made me into such an avid reader, and I’m so glad I decided to give it a chance
                in fourth grade!
